GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2025 Reentry Systems unipessoal lda

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our AGPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

0. Definitions.
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.
   "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

1. Source Code.
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

2. Basic Permissions.
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on December 20, 1996.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
   You may convey a work based on the Program, modified or translated, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
   You may convey non-source forms of a work under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License.

7. Additional Terms.
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

8. Termination.
   You may not convey a covered work if you violate this License. If you cease all violations of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors.

11. Patents.
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use of the Program under this License.

12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.
   If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, you may not convey it at all.

13. Use with the GNU General Public License.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License.

15. How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs.
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; but it is sufficient to attach them in a relevant location such as a LICENSE file:

     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
